# Title: React Project with Vite (https://vitejs.dev/)

# Description:

This repository provides a boilerplate for a React project set up with Vite, a blazing-fast development server. Vite offers hot module replacement (HMR) for an exceptional development experience.

# Prerequisites:

Node.js (version 14.18 or higher) installed on your system. You can verify your version by running node -v in your terminal. Download and install Node.js from the official website if required: https://nodejs.org/en

# Installation:

## 1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Eight-Horsepeople-of-the-Graduation/frontend.git`

### Navigate to the project directory:

`cd frontend`

## 2. Install dependencies:

`npm install`

## 3. Running the Development Server:

### Start the development server:

`npm start`
This will launch Vite's development server, typically accessible at http://localhost:5173/ in your web browser. You should see your React application running.

# Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

Vite provides seamless HMR. Any changes you make to your React components, stylesheets, or other code will be reflected instantaneously in the browser without the need for a full page reload. This significantly improves your development workflow.
This will generate an optimized production-ready build of your React application in the dist directory. You can deploy this directory to production servers.

I hope this comprehensive README file empowers you to effectively run your React project using Vite!
